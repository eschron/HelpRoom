# HelpRoom

We created HelpRoom as a resource for students to ask questions they may be too shy to ask out loud in class, or when they are stuck at a point in their work when there are no office or tutor hours.  HelpRoom is a hybrid between Piazza and Stackoverflow, but is Wellesley specific and aimed to be a tool to empower Wellesley students to take a more proactive role in helping their peers.
